## Addition With Arrays

Given two integers represented in arrays, A and B. Where each digit of the integer occupies an index in the array.
Write an NPM module that allows a developer to produce the summation of integers A + B as array C.

The resulting array C should be formatted in the same way as A and B, each digit should occupy an index.

### Examples

```
   123 [1, 2, 3]
 + 456 [4,5,6]
 -------
   579 [5,7,9]
```

Another example:

```
    11
 +  15
 -------
    26
```

A final example:

```
    111
 +   15
 -------
    126
```

It is important that **you return an array as the final result**.

You can make the assumption that the two method arguments will always be arrays of integers. Don't worry about validating input..

### How to run

```
$ npm test
```
